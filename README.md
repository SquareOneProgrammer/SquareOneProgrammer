I'm a retired chef making a shift into programming. It's a field I've had some hobby experience in over the last couple of decades, with some experience with the CS50 course audits, as well as older coding languages and UIs (quickbasic, visual basic, Unity). I'm looking to pursue a career in software development going forward, with a possible interest in game development as well.
